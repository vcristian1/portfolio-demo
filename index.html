                <p>My name is Cristian Vargas and I am an aspiring Front-End Engineer born and raised in Chicago, IL.
                    The way that
                    I look at a bottle of Selva Rey Rum is how I look at the numerous projects I have started but yet to
                    finish! I
                    first
                    ventured into the Software Engineering world in March of 2022 when I enrolled in a Full Stack Web
                    Development Bootcamp at <a href="https://bootcamp.northwestern.edu/coding/">Northwestern
                        University's School of Professional Studies.</a> Currently, my focus now
                    is
                    on building accessible and dynamic web applications to create an exceptional digital
                    experiences for my future employer and their users.</p>
