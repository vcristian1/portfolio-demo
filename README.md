# Portfolio Demo

For this assignment, I took advantage of using all of what we have learned about CSS and HTML5 to create a colorful and user friendly portfolio. I have included information about myself, my experience, current projects, and how to get in touch with me. Although this is far from the finished product, I am ecstatic of my progress in just three short weeks.
